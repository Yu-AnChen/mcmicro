Multiple-choice microscopy pipeline
{: .fs-6 .fw-300 }

MCMICRO is an end-to-end processing pipeline for multiplexed whole slide imaging and tissue microarrays developed at the [HMS Laboratory of Systems Pharmacology](https://hits.harvard.edu/the-program/laboratory-of-systems-pharmacology/about/).
The pipeline is described in a [bioRxiv preprint](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.03.15.435473v1) and accompanied by the following resources:

## Quick start

1. [Install](http://mcmicro.org/installation.html) nextflow and Docker. Check with `nextflow run hello` and `docker images` to make sure both are functional.
3. [Download](http://mcmicro.org/installation.html#exemplar-data) exemplar data. E.g., `nextflow run labsyspharm/mcmicro/exemplar.nf --name exemplar-001 --path .` to download to current directory.
4. [Run](http://mcmicro.org/running-mcmicro.html) mcmicro on the exemplars. E.g., `nextflow pull labsyspharm/mcmicro` followed by `nextflow run labsyspharm/mcmicro --in exemplar-001` to execute in current directory. 

On an average workstation, it takes approximately 5-10 minutes to process exemplar-001 from start to finish. Exemplar-002 is substantially larger, and its processing takes 30-40 minutes on an average workstation.
